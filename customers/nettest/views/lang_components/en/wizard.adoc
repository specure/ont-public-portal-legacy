If you have concerns or complaints about the speed of your Internet service, {tool} will allow you to test your connection and download a copy of the results.

In order to test normally available speed, you should run the test and save results at least five (5) times within five (5) days, at different at least one (1) hour apart intervals in off-peak hour period.

In order to test minimal available speed, you should run the test and save results at least five (5) times within five (5) days, at different at least one (1) hour apart intervals regardless of the provider’s peak hours.


Follow the instructions below to conduct a test and submit your results:

== Before running the test

We strongly recommend taking the following steps before running a test, to ensure the results are accurate:

. Connect your computer directly to your modem Internet port with an Ethernet cable (do not use WiFi or an external router).
. Disconnect fromm the modem/router ports all other devices such as computers, cameras, IPTV Set-Top Box, (those devices might consume additional traffic which consequently influences the measurement).
. Close all applications running on your computer (except for your Internet browser) including firewall and anti-virus/malware software.
. On modem/router disable all wireless (WiFi or Bluetooth) interfaces and VPN connections.

== Running the test

. Open your Internet browser and go to the {tool} website at: https://example.org/sl/[example.org (Opens a new window), window="_blank"]
