= GENERAL TERMS AND PRIVACY POLICY FOR THE USE OF THE Open Nettest SYSTEM FOR MEASURING THE QUALITY OF BROADBAND SERVICE

== General Terms for the use of the Open Nettest system for measuring the quality of broadband service

<organization> offers users the opportunity to use the Open Nettest software to test the quality and capacity of their current broadband connection. Children under 15 can use the Open Nettest with parental consent or consent of their legal guardian.

Using Open Nettest on mobile devices may cause consumption of large data amount. By using it on 3G technology the usual data amount would be between 5 and 10 MB. On 4G data amount may exceed 100 MB. Both assumptions are done using quality service. Agency takes no responsibility for large data consumption done by user and therefore related costs.

Open Nettest provides users with transparent and detailed information on the current quality of their broadband access service while respecting their privacy. The test is based on the open source and open data principle. Open source principle means that the source code of Open Nettest software is published completely. This is mainly for transparency and reliability issues. Any commercial use of Open Nettest source code, which is published under the MAME license, is not allowed. The Open Nettest logo and font are not subject to the open source and open data principle and copying, modifying or processing them in changed or unchanged form is strictly prohibited. Open Nettest measurement results data are retrievable as Open Data and available for re-use under the https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/[Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 (CC BY 4.0)], so they are freely available to the general public for information, use, dissemination and other applications.

=== Open Nettest

==== What data are processed and transmitted?

In the browser version of the Open Nettest the following data are processed:

* Ping (latency), speed and quantity of transmitted data in both directions (downlink/uplink); *
* Quality and transparency parameters (e.g. signal strength, connectivity on different ports, modifications of content, transfer time for a reference web page), and reliability of the measurement; *
* Test parameters (test method, test progress, test server, test configuration (e.g. test duration));*
* Randomly generated client ID (client UUID) and the number of performed tests;
* Public client ID (changed every 24h);*
* Client sync code and information on the client (language, local IP, version, test time and time band);*
* Indicator of the network address translation mechanisms (NAT/PAT);*
* IP version used (IPv4 or IPv6);*
* Public IP address of the user;
* WLAN network ID (WiFi SSID), numerical WLAN ID (WiFi BSSID) and encryption type;
* Name and country of service provider;*
* Geographic location of the client and direction of movement;+
* Type of device/model, OS/Open Nettest app version;+
* Public measurement ID (generated upon each measurement);+
* Anonymized public IP address (hidden last octet).

Data not marked with ( * ) *are not transmitted (public)* and *shall not be disclosed*. This data shall be accessed by the Agency only.

The data marked with asterisk ( * ) *are transmitted*; i.e. *published* and *visible* to everyone through the Open Nettest, and *made freely available* to the general public as Open Data for information, use and dissemination.

Users can at any time withdraw their acceptance of publication of the above specified data by deleting the "opendata" cookie in the "Settings" menu of their browser. Withdrawal of acceptance acts for future activities and it does not mean deleting old data stored. In the event that after the first completed measurement the user does not approve the publication of data on the clientâ€™s geolocation and direction of movement, type or model of device, OS and version of the Open Nettest app used, public measurement ID generated upon each measurement, and anonymized public IP address, the above-specified data shall not be published on the website. However, they shall remain visible in the history of the completed tests, which can be accessed by the user, and recorded in the Open Nettest database managed by the Agency. The only exception is the geographic location of the user, which is (in the event of absence of the userâ€™s approval for publication) anonymized to the circle of 300m and published in this form.

The browser version of the Open Nettest uses cookies. Cookies are small text files which are loaded in the client with the aim to improve the user experience. Open Nettest uses four cookies, which are required for the operation of the test: 

* name: RBMTTermsV2; purpose: stores the information on the userâ€™s acceptance of the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy; stored for: 10 years.
* name: RMBTuuid; purpose: stores ID of the client (client UUID); stored for: 1 year.
* name : coord; purpose: stores the userâ€™s location in the event that such information exists; Stored for: 1 hour.
* name : opendata; purpose: stores the information on the userâ€™s acceptance of publication of information, marked with plus sign (+); stored for: 10 years.

*pass:[<u>By accepting the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy the user also grants explicit approval for the use an storage of cookies.</u>]*

Users can withdraw their acceptance of publication of the above specified data at any time by deleting all cookies related to the example.org website in the "Options" menu of their respective browsers. After this the user will no longer be able to use the Open Nettest without re-accepting the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy which inform the user on the use of cookies.

==== The purpose of personal data collection

===== Primary database
All data acquired by the Agency acquired through the use of Open Nettest and results of all measurements (all data listed under section 2.1.1), which are carried out by users or the Agency are recorded in the primary database. The primary database can only be accessed by the employees of the Agency responsible for the management of the database. Users and the Agency shall use the Open Nettest system to measure the capacity and quality of network services provided by operators or service providers. The Agency shall use the collected data in order to monitor the situation and to carry out regulatory supervision in the field of fixed or mobile broadband services. The system shall show the Agency where in Slovenia and with which ISPs there are potential problems with access to internet services, where there is no mobile or wireless signal and whether operators are expanding the coverage of the specified white spots with mobile and wireless access pursuant to decisions on the assignment of radio frequencies.

All data listed under section 2.1.1 are kept in the primary database for a period of 10 years, with the exception of the userâ€™s public IP address, which is kept for a period of 6 months.

The userâ€™s public IP address is being processed in order to determine the network operator, to identify potential improper use of the system and in order to prepare a history of measurements for a specific user. After the completed test the only the network address of the IP address (anonymized public IP address) is recorded in the database and can be accessed in accordance with the open data principle. The full IP address is recorded in the primary database, but shall not be disclosed to public and can be viewed by the user only in the mobile app under "Details" or in the browser under the "History" tab.
Data on WLAN network ID is stored for the purposes of interpreting his own results of users by having overlook on this information to all his measurements stored. This is critical especially when different WiFi access points are used.

===== Public database
The selected and anonymised data from completed measurements (marked with one asterisk ( * ) or plus sign ( + ), when the user explicitly allows it) are published online and can be accessed through the example.org website, while allowing the interested public to gain an independent and realistic insight in the state of mobile, wireless and fixed communication systems and internet services on the territory of Slovenia. They provide users with information on the network coverage for a specific network or service provider at the level of regions, cities, districts or the most common regular communication routes. Information on mobile coverage is especially important for users, who travel on Slovenian territory on a daily basis, or users without the possibilities to access fixed broadband networks.

The data stored in the public database are kept for a period of 10 years.

===== Protection of personal data
The agency takes care of information security and security of premises and application system software. Accordingly, the agency has taken appropriate organizational and technical security measures to protect the personal data of individuals against accidental or unlawful destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorized disclosure or access, and other illegal and unauthorized forms of processing. Information systems are protected by anti-virus programs and a firewall. The data are not exported to third countries and are not passed on to unauthorized third parties. After the retention period, the agency anonymizes personal data so that it can no longer be linked to a specific individual.

===== Individual rights regarding data processing
In accordance with the General Data Protection Regulation, the individual has the following, in particular from the protection of personal data, rights: 

* the right to obtain from the agency confirmation as to whether personal data concerning him are being processed,
* the right to access to the personal data, which allows him to receive a copy of the personal data held by the agency about him and to verify that he is processing them lawfully,
* the right to request the rectification of personal data concerning him, 
* the right to object to the further processing of their personal data, 
* the right to erasure of personal data concerning him when there is no reason for further processing or when he exercises his right to object to the further processing,
